    <p>
      My Name is Kevin Coyle I'm a Web Developer living in Ohio and I'll make a website for your organization/business.
    </p>    

      <p>
      This is an example of what a simple one page website I could make you would look like.
      The landing image can be swapped out and the details of your website's purpose would need to be supplied by you, but the overarching structure would be the same thing.
      </p>

    <p>If you don't have a website at all, I can make you a website similar to this one in style, which is the perfect place to start. If you decide you want more content later on, you can expand off of this landing page. At the same time, if you're not sure where to take your website next, This landing page can have all of the vital information your customers need to learn more about the services your business offers. </p>

    <p>If you're interested in learning more about what a business needs to have on their website here are a two resources you can read more about the topic.
